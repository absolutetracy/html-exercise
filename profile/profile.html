      <h2 id='brief'>Brief</h2>
      <p>William Henry Gates III KBE (born
        <time datetime='1955-10-28'>October 28, 1955</time>) is an American
         business magnate, investor, author, philanthropist, humanitarian,
         and principal founder of Microsoft Corporation.
         During his career at Microsoft, Gates held the positions of chairman,
         CEO and chief software architect, while also being the largest
         individual shareholder until <time datetime='2014-05'>May 2014</time>.

        <h2 id='early-life'>Early Life</h2>
        <p>
          Gates was born in Seattle, Washington on
          <time datetime='1955-10-28'>October 28, 1955</time>.
          He is the son of <em>William H. Gates Sr.[b]</em> (b. 1925) and
          <em>Mary Maxwell Gates</em> (1929–1994). His ancestry includes
          English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish. His father was a prominent
          lawyer, and his mother served on the board of directors for First
          Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates' maternal grandfather
          was J.W, Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates has one older
          sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and a younger sister, Libby.
          He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as
          William Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix.
          Early on in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to
          pursue a law career. When Gates was young, his family regularly
          attended a church of the Congregational Christian Churches,
          a Protestant Reformed denomination. The family encouraged competition;
          one visitor reported that
          <quote>"it didn't matter whether it was hearts or
          pickleball or swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for
          winning and there was always a penalty for losing"</quote>
        </p>
        <p>
          At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory
          school.[26] When Gates was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at
          the school used proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy
          a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a
          General Electric (GE) computer for the school's students.[27] Gates
          took an interest in programming the GE system in BASIC, and was
          excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first
          computer program on this machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe
          that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was
          fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software
          code perfectly. When he reflected back on that moment, he said,
          "There was just something neat about the machine."[28] After the
          Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students sought
          time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these systems
          was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC), which
          banned four Lakeside students – Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland, and
          Kent Evans – for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in
          the operating system to obtain free computer time.

          <h3>BASIC</h3>
          <p>
            After Gates read the January 1975 issue of Popular Electronics,
            which demonstrated the Altair 8800, he contacted Micro
            Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of the
            new microcomputer, to inform them that he and others were working
            on a BASIC interpreter for the platform.[47] In reality, Gates and
            Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they
            merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts
            agreed to meet them for a demo, and over the course of a few weeks
            they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer,
            and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration, held at MITS's
            offices in Albuquerque, was a success and resulted in a deal with
            MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. Paul Allen was
            hired into MITS,[48] and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard
            to work with Allen at MITS in Albuquerque in November 1975.
            They named their partnership "Micro-Soft" and had their first office
            located in Albuquerque.[48] Within a year, the hyphen was dropped,
            and on November 26, 1976, the trade name "Microsoft" was registered
            with the Office of the Secretary of the State of New Mexico.[48]
            Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.

          <h3>IBM partnership</h3>
          <p>
            IBM approached Microsoft in July 1980 in reference to an operating
            system for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC.[51] IBM first
            proposed that Microsoft write the BASIC interpreter. When IBM's
            representatives mentioned that they needed an operating system,
            Gates referred them to Digital Research (DRI), makers of the widely
            used CP/M operating system.[52] IBM's discussions with Digital
            Research went poorly, and they did not reach a licensing agreement.
            IBM representative Jack Sams mentioned the licensing difficulties
            during a subsequent meeting with Gates and told him to get an
            acceptable operating system. A few weeks later, Gates proposed using
            86-DOS (QDOS), an operating system similar to CP/M that Tim Paterson
            of Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had made for hardware similar to
            the PC. Microsoft made a deal with SCP to become the exclusive
            licensing agent, and later the full owner, of 86-DOS. After adapting
            the operating system for the PC, Microsoft delivered it to IBM as PC
            DOS in exchange for a one-time fee of $50,000.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gates did not offer to transfer the copyright on the operating
            system, because he believed that other hardware vendors would
            clone IBM's system.[53] They did, and the sales of MS-DOS made
            Microsoft a major player in the industry.[54] Despite IBM's name on
            the operating system, the press quickly identified Microsoft as
            being very influential on the new computer. PC Magazine asked if
            Gates were "the man behind the machine?",[51] and InfoWorld quoted
            an expert as stating "it's Gates' computer".[55] Gates oversaw
            Microsoft's company restructuring on June 25, 1981, which
            re-incorporated the company in Washington state and made Gates the
            president of Microsoft and its board chairman.

          <h3>Windows</h3>
          <p>
            Microsoft launched its first retail version of Microsoft Windows on
            November 20, 1985. In August of the following year, the company
            struck a deal with IBM to develop a separate operating system called
            OS/2. Although the two companies successfully developed the first
            version of the new system, the partnership deteriorated due to
            mounting creative differences.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>Management style</h3>
          <p>
            From Microsoft's founding in 1975 until 2006, Gates had primary
            responsibility for the company's product strategy. He gained a
            reputation for being distant from others; as early as 1981 an
            industry executive complained in public that "Gates is notorious
            for not being reachable by phone and for not returning phone calls."
            [57] Another executive recalled that he showed Gates a game and
            defeated him 35 of 37 times. When they met again a month later,
            Gates "won or tied every game. He had studied the game until he
            solved it. That is a competitor."
          </p>
          <p>
            Gates was an executive who met regularly with Microsoft's senior
            managers and program managers. In firsthand accounts of these
            meetings, the managers described him being verbally combative.
            He also berated managers for perceived holes in their business
            strategies or proposals that placed the company's long-term
            interests at risk.[59][60] He interrupted presentations with such
            comments as "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!"[61] and
            "Why don't you just give up your options and join the Peace Corps?"
            [62] The target of his outburst then had to defend the proposal in
            detail until, hopefully, Gates was fully convinced.[61] When
            subordinates appeared to be procrastinating, he was known to remark
            sarcastically, "I'll do it over the weekend."
          </p>
          <p>
            During Microsoft's early history, Gates was an active software
            developer, particularly in the company's programming language
            products, but his basic role in most of the company's history was
            primarily as a manager and executive. Gates has not officially been
            on a development team since working on the TRS-80 Model 100,[66] but
            as late as 1989 he wrote code that shipped with the company's
            products.[64] He remained interested in technical details; in 1985,
            Jerry Pournelle wrote that when he watched Gates announce Microsoft
            Excel, "Something else impressed me. Bill Gates likes the program,
            not because it's going to make him a lot of money (although I'm sure
            it will do that), but because it's a neat hack."
          </p>
          <p>
            On June 15, 2006, Gates announced that over the next two years he
            would transition out of his day-to-day role to dedicate more time
            to philanthropy. He divided his responsibilities between two
            successors when he placed Ray Ozzie in charge of day-to-day
            management and Craig Mundie in charge of long-term product strategy.

        <p>
          Since leaving day-to-day operations at Microsoft, Gates has continued
          his philanthropy and works on other projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Gates was the world's
          highest-earning billionaire in 2013, as his net worth increased by
          US$15.8 billion to US$78.5 billion. As of January 2014, most of Gates'
          assets are held in Cascade Investment LLC, an entity through which he
          owns stakes in numerous businesses, including Four Seasons Hotels and
          Resorts, and Corbis Corp.[75] On February 4, 2014, Gates stepped down
          as chairman of Microsoft to become Technology Advisor alongside new
          CEO Satya Nadella.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gates provided his perspective on a range of issues in a substantial
          interview that was published in the March 27, 2014 issue of Rolling
          Stone magazine. In the interview, Gates provided his perspective on
          climate change, his charitable activities, various tech companies and
          people involved in them, and the state of America. In response to a
          question about his greatest fear when he looks 50 years into the
          future, Gates stated: "... there'll be some really bad things that'll
          happen in the next 50 or 100 years, but hopefully none of them on the
          scale of, say, a million people that you didn't expect to die from a
          pandemic, or nuclear or bioterrorism." Gates also identified innovation
          as the "real driver of progress" and pronounced that "America's way
          better today than it's ever been."

        <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
        <p>
          In 2009, Gates and Warren Buffett founded The Giving Pledge, whereby
          they and other billionaires pledge to give at least half of their
          wealth to philanthropy.
        </p>
        <section>
          <h3>Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation</h3>
          <p>
            Gates studied the work of Andrew Carnegie and John D. Rockefeller,
            and donated some of his Microsoft stock in 1994 to create the
            "William H. Gates Foundation." In 2000, Gates and his wife combined
            three family foundations and Gates donated stock valued at $5
            billion to create the charitable Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation,
            which was identified by the Funds for NGOs company in 2013, as the
            world's wealthiest charitable foundation, with assets reportedly
            valued at more than $34.6 billion.[85][86] The Foundation allows
            benefactors to access information that shows how its money is being
            spent, unlike other major charitable organizations such as the
            Wellcome Trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gates has credited the generosity and extensive philanthropy of
            David Rockefeller as a major influence. Gates and his father met
            with Rockefeller several times, and their charity work is partly
            modeled on the Rockefeller family's philanthropic focus, whereby
            they are interested in tackling the global problems that are ignored
            by governments and other organizations.[89] As of 2007, Bill and
            Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in
            America, having given over $28 billion to charity;[90] the couple
            plan to eventually donate 95 percent of their wealth to charity.
          </p>
          <p>
            The foundation is organized into four program areas: Global
            Development Division, Global Health Division, United States
            Division, and Global Policy & Advocacy Division.[92] The foundation
            supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural
            development. Specifically, the foundation is supporting the
            International Rice Research Institute in developing Golden Rice,
            a genetically modified rice variant used to combat
            Vitamin A deficiency.

        <section>
          <h3>Personal donations</h3>
          <p>
            Melinda Gates suggested that people should emulate the philanthropic
            efforts of the Salwen family, which had sold its home and given away
            half of its value, as detailed in The Power of Half.[94] Gates and
            his wife invited Joan Salwen to Seattle to speak about what the
            family had done, and on December 9, 2010, Bill and Melinda Gates,
            and investor Warren Buffett signed a commitment they called the
            "Giving Pledge." The pledge is a commitment by all three to donate
            at least half of their wealth over the course of time to charity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gates has also provided personal donations to educational
            institutions. In 1999, Gates donated $20 million to the
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) for the construction of
            a computer laboratory named the "William H. Gates Building" that was
            designed by architect Frank Gehry. While Microsoft had previously
            given financial support to the institution, this was the first
            personal donation received from Gates.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Maxwell Dworkin Laboratory of the Harvard John A. Paulson School
            of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named after the mothers of
            both Gates and Microsoft President Steven A. Ballmer, both of whom
            were students (Ballmer was a member of the School's graduating class
            of 1977, while Gates left his studies for Microsoft), and donated
            funds for the laboratory's construction.[99] Gates also donated $6
            million to the construction of the Gates Computer Science Building,
            completed in January 1996, on the campus of Stanford University.
            The building contains the Computer Science Department (CSD) and the
            Computer Systems Laboratory (CSL) of Stanford's Engineering
            department.
          </p>
          <p>
            On August 15, 2014, Bill Gates posted a video of himself on Facebook
            in which he is seen dumping a bucket of ice water on his head. Gates
            posted the video after Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg challenged
            him to do so in order to raise awareness for the disease ALS
            (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis).
          </p>
          <p>
            Since about 2005, Bill Gates and his foundation have taken an
            interest in solving global sanitation problems. For example, they
            announced the "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge", which has received
            considerable media interest.[102] To raise awareness for the topic
            of sanitation and possible solutions, Gates drank water that was
            "produced from human feces" in 2014 – in fact it was produced from
            a sewage sludge treatment process called the Omni-processor.[103][104]
            In early 2015, he also appeared with Jimmy Fallon on The Tonight
            Show and challenged him to see if he could taste the difference
            between this reclaimed water or bottled water
          </p>
          <p>
            In November 2017, Gates said he would give $50 million to the
            Dementia Discovery Fund, a venture capital that seeks treatment
            for Alzheimer's disease. He also pledged an additional $50 million
            to start-up ventures working in Alzheimer’s research
          </p>
          <p>
            Bill and Melinda Gates have said that they intend to leave their
            three children $10 million each as their inheritance. With only $30
            million kept in the family, they appear to be on a course to give
            away about 99.96 percent of their wealth.[107] On 25 August 2018,
            Gates distributed $600,000 through his Melinda and Gates Foundation
            via UNICEF which is helping flood affected victims in Kerala, India.

          <h3>Criticism</h3>
          <p>
            In 2007, the Los Angeles Times criticized the foundation for
            investing its assets in companies that have been accused of
            worsening poverty, polluting heavily, and pharmaceutical companies
            that do not sell to developing countries.[109] In response to press
            criticism, the foundation announced a review of its investments to
            assess social responsibility.[110] It subsequently canceled the
            review and stood by its policy of investing for maximum return,
            while using voting rights to influence company practices.[111] The
            Gates Millennium Scholars program has been criticized by
            Ernest W. Lefever for its exclusion of Caucasian students.[112]
            The scholarship program is administered by the United Negro College
            Fund.[113] In 2014, Bill Gates sparked a protest in Vancouver when
